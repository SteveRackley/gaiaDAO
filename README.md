Re-imagining Governance of the Global Commons

Here is the Abstract of the gaiaDAO White Paper, which is currently being reviewed prior to initial release.

Abstract
gaiaDAO is conceived as a distributed autonomous organization whose mission is to nudge the global economy towards a realistic and sustainable pricing-in of the Earth's ecosystem services, starting with those provided by the atmosphere. This will be achieved by engaging in GHG emissions trading to encourage a common, sustainable carbon price and, in the mid- to long-term, through the sponsorship and execution of a range of projects, including negative emissions research and development projects.

The DAO operation is based on an open blockchain secured ledger of transaction and contracts (i.e. emissions permit purchases and retirements, project initiation and management). Block generation, verification, and security is maintained using a proof-of-stake method, by DAO Stakeholders whose stake is based on the number of emissions permits held off-market. Permits lodged and verified in the ledger are reflected by an equivalent holding of emissions tokens (or Ore, one Ore being equivalent to a 1 t-CO2e emission permit.)

Emissions permit transactions can be made through the gaiaDAOexchange, which is part of the gaiaDAO operation, while verified permit purchase transactions from other exchanges can also be submitted to the ledger. Services provided by gaiaDAO Stakeholders (block verification and security, payment services and code development) are rewarded through the allocation of Ore tokens, equivalent emissions permits being purchased using a proportion of transaction fees.

gaiaDAO Membership is gained by the retirement of emissions permits lodged in the ledger, the retirement being analogous to a "proof-of-burn". Permit "burning" is rewarded by the issue of Aura tokens to gaiaDAO Members, who collectively select and manage the project activities funded by the remaining proportion of transaction fees.

gaiaDAO is conceived as a not-for-profits organization, all transaction fees, project outcomes (such as CERs), and donations, being used to further the aim of the Members - protection of the Global Commons. While Ore are directly convertible by gaiaDAO Stakeholders to a real world asset (i.e. emissions permits), it is not envisaged that Aura tokens will be publicly traded or convertible to currencies or other assets.
